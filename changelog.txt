Weather_Plus8.3 #update by Adriano
* Improved the city search function, now it gives more results and it accepts only the postal codes compatible with the API, i.e. those indicated in the help window by pressing F1.
* Eliminated a check for the previous Yahoo API that pressing NVDA + shift + w gave an IndexError for a city with a local date greater or less than that of the system.
* Added local date in city details.
* Improved coding in Remove, Rename and Save cities (for NVDA with python 2)
* Improved the forecast output windows, now the commands ctrl + a and ctrl + c also work and you can also close them with the enter key.
* Eliminated function for calculating atmospheric pressure, now use the one reported by the Weather API, someone complained that it was not reliable ... I hope that now with that of the API will be more satisfied.

## FYI:

This repository was forked from:
https://github.com/zstanecic/weather_plus

You can find this new modified repository for the Addon Weather_Plus at:
https://github.com/BlindHelp/weather_plus

# Deleted:

I have deleted all the Master branch files relating to Weather_Plus who came in the root of the original weather_plus repository forked.
I have deleted oldest readme.md, buildVars.py files.
I have deleted oldest folders inside the addon folder.

# Added:

I have put all the folders and files found in the Weather_Plus8.1  addon, including the DOC-Local folders updated by Adriano.
I have added the new Readme.md file and the BuildVars.py file modified by Adriano with its latest changes for Weather_Plus8.1.
We only have the Master branch. I think it is not necessary to create any stable branch, much confusion in my opinion and so file conflicts are avoided as in the previous cloned weather_plus repository.

# Created the new tag:

git tag v8.1

# Created the new tag:

git tag v8.2
Replaced the locale folder by the new locale  folder sent by Adriano, including files:
__init__.py
buildVars.py
for Weather_Plus8.2

Translated new string in french and spanish.

scons -c # To clean the content of the unnotuous files in the Locale folder, manifest.ini, nvda.mo.

Created the new file:
Weather_Plus.pot # 345 strings for Weather_Plus8.2.
With the scons pot command.

Updated translation for hr language in locale folder by Tarik Hadžirović. Thanks.

# Some useful git commands:

git add .

git commit -m "Explanatory message"

git push origin master
or
git push

This also works for me

If Adriano has decided, for example, that the version must be incremented, for example from 8.1 to 8.2, after correcting the buildVars.py file for example, change line 33 as follows:

	"addon_version" : "8.1",

Put in place:

	"addon_version" : "8.2",

tap the following command, to create the  new TAG v8.2 in our local repositori.

git tag v8.2

However, if we still remain in the same version as before, for example 8.1 currently, it is necessary to ignore the step before.

Then delete the tag locally and then recreate it, as follows:

To delete  use this command:

git tag -d v8.1

To recreate use this command:

git tag v8.1

#

After building the addon with the command scons, you can clean the working directory by running the following command:

scons -c

To create the message file used in Poedit to send it to the ADDON WEATHER_PLUS translators, do the command:

scons pot

You can use this file To clean-up  the repository and be able to create the addon:
